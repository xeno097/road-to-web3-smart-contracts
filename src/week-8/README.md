# Week 8

[Week 8](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-build-an-nft-marketplace-from-scratch) consisted in developing an betting game using the [commit reveal scheme](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/commit-reveal-scheme-on-ethereum) and deploying it on [Optimism](https://community.optimism.io/).

The challenge required the developer to:

- Require both players to submit a obfuscated value to be revealed later.
- Allow players to forfeit if the other does not reveal his random number after x time.
