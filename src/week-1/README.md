# Week 1

[Week 1](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-develop-an-nft-smart-contract-erc721-with-alchemy) consisted in developing an ERC721 smart contract with the help of [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/).

The challenge required the developer to:

- Allow a user to only mint a limited number of NFTs.
- Use the mapping type.
