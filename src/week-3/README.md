# Week 3

[Week 3](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-make-nfts-with-on-chain-metadata-hardhat-and-javascript) consisted in developing an NFT smart contract with on-chain metadata.

The challenge required the developer to:

- Use struct to add more stats to the characters (Level, Speed, Strength, Life, ...) instead of only storing the level in a mapping.
- Use pseudo-random number generation to initialize the character stats (Note that the solution implemented in this contract is not truly random).
