# Week 6

[Week 6](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-build-a-staking-dapp) consisted in developing a very simple staking smart contract.

The challenge required the developer to:

- Change the initial staking reward mechanism to a non linear one.
- Allow users to deposit an arbitrary amount of ETH.
- Implement a mechanism that allows to start a new staking period by withdrawing ETH from the external contract.
