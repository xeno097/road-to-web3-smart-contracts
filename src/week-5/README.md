# Week 5

[Week 5](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/connect-apis-to-your-smart-contracts-using-chainlink) consisted in developing an NFT smart contract with dynamic metadata using [chainlink price feeds](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds).

The challenge required the developer to:

- Use [chainlink vrf](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/introduction) to randomly select NFT metadata from one of the possible URIs after a price update.
