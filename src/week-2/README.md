# Week 2

[Week 2](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-build-buy-me-a-coffee-defi-dapp) consisted in developing a smart contract that allows users to donate ETH to the contract's owner.

The challenge required the developer to:

- Allow the withdrawal address to be updated.
- Implement a `buyLargeCoffee` function that allows the user to "buy a large coffe" for 0.003 ETH.
