# Road to Web3 Smart Contracts

This repository holds the Smart Contracts for [Alchemy Road to Web3](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/welcome-to-the-road-to-web3) weekly projects.

This project uses [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) to test the smart contract logic instead of [Hardhat](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat), that is used for the projects development in the original course.

## Disclaimer

***Do not use*** the Smart Contracts in this repository as they are for any serious project that is going to be deployed to mainnet as they have not been audited and surely have bugs that can be exploited by malicious third parties.

I won't be responsible for the third world war, your favourite soccer team losing or Ethereum going to 0.

## Folder Structure

The smart contracts are grouped by week in the `./src` folder as any default Foundry project. Tests follow the same folder strcuture under the `./test` directory.
